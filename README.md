Every huge building gets really hot inside from the sun coming in through the windows and people walking around and due to that building get uncomfortably hot. The solution for hot buildings are commercial HVAC systems the only issue is that these HVAC systems are designed to break themselves and are extremely inefficient. Each HVAC system has an internal loop of water that gets hot absorbing the heat from the building and connects to an external loop that is open to allow the heat to escape. To represent the complexity of a cooling tower I am using a leaky bucket that returns different bucket sizes, different amounts of water and a leakage rate that represents cooling tower size, volume of water inside the tower and the evaporation rate of pure H20. Being able to render something as complex as a cooling tower can help commercial/ industrial applications by have a co-pilot to assist them in knowing what to expect and when you expect it.
